# Data visualization of the Olympic Games

As a follow-up to the project using SQL, I created a small dashboard in Power BI dedicated to the analysis of the Olympic Games!<br>
<br>
My interactive dashboard features:<br>
Medal count: Achievements by countries and sports.<br>
Geography of participants: Analysis of the number of participants from different countries.<br>
Historical trends: Analyze participants, sports and countries.<br>
Gender Equality: Progress in Gender Equality.<br>
<br>
