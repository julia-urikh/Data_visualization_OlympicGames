# Data visualization of the Olympic Games

As a follow-up to the project using SQL, I created a small dashboard in Power BI dedicated to the analysis of the Olympic Games!

My interactive dashboard features:
Medal count: Achievements by countries and sports.
Geography of participants: Analysis of the number of participants from different countries.
Historical trends: Analyze participants, sports and countries.
Gender Equality: Progress in Gender Equality.
